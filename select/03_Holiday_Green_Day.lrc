[00:09.08] Say hey!
[00:13.00] Cha!
[00:15.00] 
[00:20.26] Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
[00:23.30] Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey)
[00:26.99] The shame, the ones who died without a name
[00:33.02] Hear the dogs howling out of key
[00:36.41] To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey)
[00:40.29] And bleed, the company lost the war today
[00:46.14] I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
[00:52.76] This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
[00:59.54] On holiday
[01:07.54] Hear the drum pounding out of time
[01:10.83] Another protester has crossed the line (hey)
[01:14.67] To find the money's on the other side
[01:20.71] Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
[01:24.07] There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey)
[01:27.70] A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
[01:33.66] I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
[01:40.28] This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
[01:47.22] On holiday
[01:52.22] 
[01:54.51] (Hey)
[01:57.01] 
[02:16.54] (Three, four)
[02:23.04] 
[02:25.74] "The representative from California has the floor"
[02:31.02] "Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman
[02:34.47] Bombs away is your punishment
[02:37.74] Pulverize the Eiffel towers
[02:40.76] Who criticize your government
[02:44.13] Bang bang goes the broken glass, and
[02:47.58] Kill all the fags that don't agree
[02:50.90] Trials by fire, setting fire
[02:54.09] Is not a way that's meant for me
[02:57.55] Just 'cause (hey, hey, hey, hey)
[03:00.56] Just 'cause (hey, hey, hey, hey)
[03:01.60] Because we're outlaws, yeah!
[03:04.28] I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
[03:10.37] This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
[03:17.04] I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
[03:23.44] This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
[03:32.22] This is our lives on holiday!
